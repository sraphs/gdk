# The Go Development Kit

The Go Development Kit (GDK) is an open source project building libraries and 
tools to improve the experience of developing with Go.
## Installing and getting started

To start using the GDK, install it using `go get`:

```shell
go get github.com/sraphs/gdk
```

## Project status

We're looking for early adopters to help us validate the APIs before releasing
a beta version. Please try it and provide feedback by filing a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/sraphs/gdk/issues).
